# OrderDataViz
## Order Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description

This project involves analyzing and visualizing order data from a CSV file (`orders.csv`). The key steps undertaken in this project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. The primary objective is to gain insights into the order data and identify key trends and patterns.

## Files

- **orders.csv**: Contains the raw order data with various attributes such as order details, shipping mode, customer segment, product details, and pricing.
- **Order_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved:
1. Handling missing values.
2. Converting data types for appropriate columns.
3. Standardizing categorical variables.
4. Removing duplicates and correcting erroneous data entries.

## Data Visualization

Several visualizations were created to explore and present the data:
1. **Distribution of Order Dates**: Analysis of order frequency over time.
2. **Shipping Mode Analysis**: Evaluation of different shipping modes and their usage.
3. **Segment Analysis**: Insights into different customer segments.
4. **Geographical Analysis**: Analysis of orders based on country, state, and city.
5. **Category and Sub-Category Analysis**: Detailed analysis of product categories and sub-categories.
6. **Pricing and Discount Analysis**: Examination of pricing strategies and discount patterns.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Project-4.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive overview of order data through systematic data cleaning and visualization. The insights derived from the analysis can be valuable for decision-making and strategic planning in sales and operations.
